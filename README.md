# Onlinespaces Ruby SaaS framework
Created by Scott Collier [Onlinespaces](http://www.onlinespaces.com)

This is a starter framework for a SaaS (Software as a Service) application written using Ruby On Rails.

You can see this site @ https://whispering-depths-62478.herokuapp.com/. This is running on a free Heroku account. 
So, if you get an error when visting the page for the first time, please refresh the page as the server has probably been put to sleep.

## Features
- User account creation and management
- User profile management (Create and modify)

- bootstrap-sass

## Warning

This is my first Ruby On Rails application and was created just to create a Ruby On Rails application. 

So, as with all code grabbed of of the Internet, please look through the code before deploying it.

Also, this is not a complete application.

If you see anything, that would make this better, please feel free to **nicely** share it. That would be awesome!
